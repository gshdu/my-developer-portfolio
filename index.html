            <p>I've already mastered the fundamentals of HTML and CSS. I am capable of creating any simple website. I'm
                even capable of teaching my juniors how to create a small website. My objective is to construct bigger
                websites and get knowledge in advance topics.</p>

                <p>Coding was one of the best decisions I've made in my life. My childhood goal was to become a coder.
                    After passing my Higher Secondary exam, I began my adventure into full-stack web development
                    programming. I would have been unable to progress until I found Programming Hero's full-stack
                    programming course. I am hopeful because of the detailed beginner-friendly support.</p>
